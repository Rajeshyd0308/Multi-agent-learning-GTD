# Multi-agent-learning-GTD
Developed a multi-agent Gradient TD Learning algorithm for solving an MDP using which each agent learns common set of parameters without sharing the data samples.
Analyzed the decay of TD error of this algorithm under communication constraints in multi-agent variant 2D Maze environments.
